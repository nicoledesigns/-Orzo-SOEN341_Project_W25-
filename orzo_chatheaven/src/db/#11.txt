15;As of today, October 26, 2023, the latest and greatest consumer NVIDIA GPUs are the **GeForce RTX 40 Series**.  Specifically:*   **Top-End:** The **GeForce RTX 4090** is the current flagship, offering unparalleled performance.*   **High-End:** Below that are the **GeForce RTX 4080** and **GeForce RTX 4070 Ti**, offering excellent performance for high-resolution gaming and demanding tasks.*   **Mid-Range:** The **GeForce RTX 4070** and **GeForce RTX 4060 Ti** offer a more accessible price point while still providing a great gaming experience. The **GeForce RTX 4060** is the current entry level card in the 40 series.Keep in mind:*   **"Latest" is relative:**  New GPUs are released periodically. NVIDIA often releases new variants or updated versions within a series.*   **Professional GPUs:** The professional NVIDIA GPUs (like the NVIDIA RTX series for workstations) are on a different release schedule and have different performance characteristics. My answer is focused on the GeForce series intended for gaming and general consumer use.To stay *absolutely* up-to-date, it's best to check the official NVIDIA website.;Apr 08 2025 09:34

15;For Red Dead Redemption 2 at maximum settings, you'll want at least an **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080** or **AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT**. For the best experience, an **RTX 4080** or **RX 7900 XT** and above will provide smoother frame rates, especially at higher resolutions.;Apr 08 2025 09:41
